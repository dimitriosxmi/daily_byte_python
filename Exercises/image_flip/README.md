Given an image represented as a 2D array of pixels, return the image rotation ninety degrees.

Ex: Given the following image…

```
image = [
    [10, 11, 12],
    [13, 14, 15],
    [16, 17, 18]
], return the image such that it's been modified as follows...
[
    [16,13,10],
    [17,14,11],
    [18,15,12]
]
```
